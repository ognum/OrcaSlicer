# Gemini 3 Pro in Antigravity

## Overview
This document outlines the capabilities and workflow for Gemini 3 Pro operating within the Antigravity environment, specifically tailored for the OrcaSlicer modification project.

## Capabilities

### 1. Code Modification & Engineering
-   **Deep Codebase Understanding**: Ability to analyze large C++ codebases, understand complex dependencies (CMake, Boost, etc.), and navigate intricate project structures.
-   **Feature Implementation**: Capable of designing and implementing complete feature sets, from backend logic in `libslic3r` to frontend integration in `src/slic3r/GUI`.
-   **Refactoring & Optimization**: Identifying technical debt, optimizing algorithms, and improving code maintainability.

### 2. User Interface Design & Implementation
-   **wxWidgets Expertise**: Proficient in modifying and extending wxWidgets-based GUIs.
-   **Modern UI/UX Principles**: Applying modern design aesthetics to desktop applications, ensuring a premium and responsive user experience.
-   **Dynamic Interactions**: Implementing interactive elements and smooth transitions.

### 3. Asset Creation
-   **Image Generation**: Utilizing the `generate_image` tool to create high-quality PNG and SVG assets for icons, buttons, and UI elements.
-   **Visual Design**: Designing cohesive visual themes and style guides.

### 4. Documentation
-   **Technical Documentation**: Writing clear and comprehensive documentation for code, APIs, and architectures.
-   **User Documentation**: Creating user guides, release notes, and feature walkthroughs.
-   **Project Management**: Maintaining `task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, and `walkthrough.md` to track progress and decisions.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective is to perform heavy modifications to the OrcaSlicer application, including:

-   **New Feature Sets**: Integrating novel functionalities (e.g., hybrid milling/printing, advanced thermal controls).
-   **UI Overhaul**: Modernizing the user interface to improve usability and aesthetics.
-   **Asset Refresh**: Creating custom icons and graphics to match the new design language.
-   **Comprehensive Documentation**: Documenting all changes and new features for future maintainability.

## Workflow

1.  **Planning**: Analyze requirements, research existing code, and create a detailed `implementation_plan.md`.
2.  **Execution**: Implement changes iteratively, using `task.md` to track progress.
3.  **Verification**: Verify changes through automated tests and manual walkthroughs, documented in `walkthrough.md`.
4.  **Review**: Engage with the user for feedback and approval at critical checkpoints.
